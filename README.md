# cytracepy-eval
Scripts that were used to investigate the behaviour of the cytracepy distance function.

The presentation that was given can be found (here) [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iR3xLo0DC_267GFLQGH5piWyICxV7LDDyKX42GptoQ8/edit?usp=sharing]

In silico data was derived from the prossttYY trajectory model and given to us in a collaboration with Lucas Pinello's lab. 

(For students and staff of the stuart lab) The entire tar'd insilico directory can be found tap at /projects/sysbio/users/cellAtlas/data/insilico-trajectory .

For this experiment, sub samples of bifurcated trees were created and compared (see presentation for clearer explanation). That data can be found in this repo in data/13_data data/3_data.

The general idea and set up was to leverage the trajectory docker containers and bash to run off all the experiments. You can see the scripts in the /src directory that fire off the dockers.
